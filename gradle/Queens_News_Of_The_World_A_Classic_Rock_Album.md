The album was inspired by the American tour that the band did in 1977, where they encountered different audiences and musical influences. The album's title and cover art were taken from a science fiction magazine that drummer Roger Taylor had as a child. The cover depicts a giant robot holding the dead bodies of the band members, which was a contrast to their previous glamorous and flamboyant image.
 
The album received mixed reviews from critics at the time, but has since been recognized as a classic rock album and one of Queen's best works. The album has sold over 10 million copies worldwide and has been certified 4x platinum in the US and 2x platinum in the UK. The album also influenced many other artists and genres, such as punk rock, heavy metal and hip hop.

The album opens with the anthemic "We Will Rock You", which features a simple but powerful rhythm of stomping and clapping, followed by Brian May's guitar solo. The song was written by May as a response to the audience participation that the band witnessed during their concerts. The song has become a staple of sports events and popular culture, and has been covered by many artists.
 
The next song is "We Are The Champions", which was written by Freddie Mercury as a tribute to the band's fans and their own perseverance. The song is a power ballad with a soaring chorus and a piano accompaniment. The song has also become a popular anthem for various causes and events, and was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 2009.
 
The album then shifts to a heavier and darker tone with "Sheer Heart Attack", which was written by Taylor as a criticism of the punk rock movement that was emerging at the time. The song features a fast and aggressive tempo, distorted guitars and vocals, and lyrics that mock the punk ethos. The song was also the title of the band's previous album, which was released in 1974.
  
The fourth song on the album is "All Dead, All Dead", which was written and sung by May. The song is a melancholic ballad that reflects on the loss of a loved one. The song was inspired by the death of May's childhood cat, Pixie. The song features a gentle piano and guitar arrangement, and a harmony vocal by Mercury.
 
The next song is "Spread Your Wings", which was written by bassist John Deacon. The song is a motivational rock ballad that tells the story of a young man who dreams of leaving his dull life and pursuing his ambitions. The song features a prominent bass line, a piano solo by Mercury, and a guitar solo by May. The song was also used as the soundtrack for a promotional video that showed the band performing in the snow at Roger Taylor's garden.
 
The sixth song on the album is "Fight From The Inside", which was written and sung by Taylor. The song is a funk rock track that encourages the listener to resist conformity and oppression. The song features Taylor playing most of the instruments, including drums, guitars, bass and vocals, with only Mercury adding some backing vocals and May adding some guitar effects.
